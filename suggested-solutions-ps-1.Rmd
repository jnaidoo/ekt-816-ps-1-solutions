This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Data Manipulation in R

## Filtering, Sorting, and Generating New Variables

5. Do exercise 1 from section 5.2.4 of @Wickham2017.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
library(skimr)

# skimr is useful for examining summary stats

# let's confirm that we have the right data loaded into memory
# View(flights)
```
Let's eyeball the data:

```{r}
# plot a histogram of the arrival delay (in minutes)
# notice that some delays are negative
ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = arr_delay)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)

# notice we get a warning that 9430 rows have "non-finite values" - are they missing or NA?
library(skimr)
skim(flights, arr_delay)

# interesting to note that the median flight is actually 5 minutes early!
# 1.1. arrival delay >= 2 hrs
late_flights = filter(flights, arr_delay >= 120)

# 1.2 flew NYC --> Houston
to_Houston = filter(flights, dest == "IAH" | dest == "HOU")

# 1.3. operated by United, American or Delta
# -- how do we find the codes corresponding to each airline?
# -- use the "airlines" data (tibble)
view(airlines)
selected_airlines = filter(flights, carrier %in% c("AA", "UA", "DL"))

# 1.4. departed in summer (July - September)
summer_flights = flights %>% filter(month %in% 7:9)

# 1.5 arrived more than two hours late, but didn't leave late
late_but_on_time_departure = late_flights %>% filter(dep_delay <= 0)

# 1.6 delayed by over an hour, but made up at least half an hour in flight
catch_up = flights %>% filter(dep_delay >= 60 & arr_delay <= dep_delay - 30)

# 1.7 departed between midnight and 6AM, inclusive
night_departures = flights %>% filter(dep_time %in% 0:600)
```

6. Do exercises 3-4 of section 5.3.1 of @Wickham2017.
```{r}

# 3. sort flights to find the fastest flights
# one thing to note here is that air_time gives the time in the air
# i.e. excluding time on the runway waiting to take off or dock at the destination
head(arrange(flights, air_time))
# by inspecting this, we see there were two flights which spent only 20m in the air
# most likely, these are to small regional airports

# 4. longest and shortest distances travelled
head(arrange(flights, distance))
# the shortest flight is entirely within the NYC area: from LGA to EWR, a distance of 17 miles
tail(arrange(flights,distance))
# the longest flights are to HNL (Honululu)
# this gives us a clue that these data must only be on domestic flights
```


7. Do exercise 2 of section 5.5.2 of @Wickham2017
```{r}
df = transmute(flights,
  air_time,
  naive_duration = arr_time - dep_time
  )

# if air_time = flight duration = arr_time - dep_time, this scatterplot would have every point on the diagonal 
ggplot(df, aes(x=air_time, y=naive_duration)) + geom_point()

# some reasons for discrepancies (not exhaustive):
# -- delays where planes were not in the air (time on runway, taxiing)
# -- arr_time and dep_time are not actually in comparable units 
#   ** e.g. "630" - "530" should give 60 m, not 100
# -- differences in time zones (arr_time, dep_time are in local time)
```
