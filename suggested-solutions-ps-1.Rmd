```

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Data Manipulation in R

## Filtering, Sorting, and Generating New Variables

5. Do exercise 1 from section 5.2.4 of @Wickham2017.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)

# let's confirm that we have the right data loaded into memory
View(flights)
```
Let's eyeball the data:

```{r}
# plot a histogram of the arrival delay (in minutes)
# notice that some delays are negative
ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = arr_delay)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)

# notice we get a warning that 9430 rows have "non-finite values" - are they missing or NA?
library(skimr)
skim(flights, arr_delay)

# interesting to note that the median flight is actually 5 minutes early!
late_flights = filter(flights, arr_delay >= 120)
```
